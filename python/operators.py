## Arifmetic operators

a = 10
b = 20

# adddition +
c = a + b

# subtraction -
c = a - b

# multiplication *
c = a * b

# division /
c = b / a 

# modulus %
c = b % a

# exponent ** b to power a
c = b**a

#floor division //
c = 9//2 ## = 4


## Comparison Operators
a = true
b = false

# equal ==
a == b

# not equal !=
a != b

# not equal <>
a <> b

# greater than >
a = 10
b = 11

a > b

# lower than <
a < b

# greater than or equal >=
a >= b

# lower than or equal <=
a <= b

## Assignment operators

# assign
a = 1

# incremental assign +=
a += 1

# decremental assign -=
a -= 1

# multiply assign *=
a *= b

# divide and assign /=
a /= 2

# modulus and assign
a %= 2

# exponenet and assign
a **= 2

# floor division and assign
a //= 4

## Bitwise operators

a = 00111100
b = 00001101

# binary AND (copy bit wich exists in both operands)
c = a&b

# binary OR (copy if it exist in one of operands)
c = a|b

# binary XOR (copy if it exist on only one operand not both)
c = a^b

# binary Ones Compelement (replaces 1's to 0's and 0's to 1's) reverse
c = ~a

# binary left shift 
a <<

# binary right shift
a >>


## Membership operators

# evaluates true if variables on both sides link to one object otheervise falsea 
a is b

# evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false othervise 
x not in y

## Identity operators
